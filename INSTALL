INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN UNIX or MACOSX MACHINES
[For Windows machines, look at the end of this file]

For the compilation, you need
   the Objective Caml compiler version 3.01
   the preprocessor Camlp4 version 3.01.6
installed in your computer.

They are freely distributed at addresses:
     http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
     http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/

It may compile with other (older or newer) versions of OCaml and Camlp4,
but no warranty: however, if you manage to compile, it has good chances
to be correct.

1- If the command ocamlc.opt is not installed, edit the file
   "tools/Makefile.inc" and change:
       OCAMLC=ocamlc.opt
       OCAMLOPT=ocamlopt.opt
   into
       OCAMLC=ocamlc
       OCAMLOPT=ocamlopt

2- If your platform has the command ocamlopt, do:
      make
   Otherwise do (warning: slower executables):
      make out

3- Do:
      make distrib

   This creates a directory "distribution" where all executables programs
   and documentation are copied.

   This can constitute a "distribution" directory if you want to distribute
   executables.

4- To use GeneWeb, move the directory "distribution" to another place, or
   rename it.

   Go to this directory and launch the command "./gwsetup".

   The reason why it is better to move this directory is that "make clean"
   deletes it, and another "make distrib" overwrites it. If you created
   genealogic databases inside, they would be deleted.


INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN WINDOWS NT/95/98

Version 3.01 of OCaml has a serious bug prevening GeneWeb to be compiled.
Latest version of GeneWeb have been compiled thanks to some hacks.
