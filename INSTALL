INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN UNIX MACHINES

1- For the compilation, you need the Objective Caml compiler version
   2.00 and the preprocessor Camlp4 version 2.00 installed in your machine.
   They are freely distributed at addresses:
      http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
      http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/

2- From the top directory, do:
      make
   This creates executables for the Objective Caml interpretor.

3- If your platform is supported by the native-code Ocaml compiler, you
   can build the native-code programs. Do:
      make opt

4- Do:
      make distrib

   This creates a directory "distribution" where all executables programs
   and documentation are copied. Read the file README.txt in this directory
   and follow the instructions.


INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN WINDOWS NT

You need:

- The Cygnus interface.

- The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

- The Objective Caml compiler (binaries are sufficient).

- The preprocessor Camlp4 (binaries are not distributed, you need to
  download the sources and compile it).

In directory tools, move the file Makefile.inc as another name, and move
the file Makefile.inc.win as Makefile.inc.

Then follow the same instructions above than for the Unix installation.
