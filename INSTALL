INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN UNIX MACHINES
[For Windows machines, look at the end of this file]

For the compilation, you need
   the Objective Caml compiler version 2.01 or 2.02
   the preprocessor Camlp4 version 2.01 or 2.02
installed in your computer.

They are freely distributed at addresses:
     http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
     http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/

1- If the command ocamlc.opt is not installed, edit the file
   "tools/Makefile.inc" and change:
       OCAMLC=ocamlc.opt
       OCAMLOPT=ocamlopt.opt
   into
       OCAMLC=ocamlc
       OCAMLOPT=ocamlopt

2- If your platform has the command ocamlopt, do:
      make
   Otherwise do (warning: slower executables):
      make out

3- Do:
      make distrib

   This creates a directory "distribution" where all executables programs
   and documentation are copied.

   This can constitute a "distribution" directory if you want to distribute
   executables.

4- To use GeneWeb, move the directory "distribution" to another place, or
   rename it.

   Go to this directory and launch the command "setup".

   The reason why it is better to move this directory is that "make clean"
   deletes it, and another "make distrib" scratches it. If you created
   genealogic databases inside, they would be deleted.


INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN WINDOWS NT/95/98

You need:

- The Cygnus GNU-Win32 development tool, free, available at:
	http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/

- The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

- The Microsoft Assembler masm.

- The Objective Caml compiler (get the binaries, *not* the sources, which are
  not compilable under Cygnus GUN-Win32).

- The preprocessor Camlp4 (binaries are not distributed, you need to
  download the sources and compile it).

In directory tools, move the file Makefile.inc as another name, and
move the file Makefile.inc.win as Makefile.inc. Edit it and possibly
change "CAMLP4D" and "LIBUNIX" to point file where the corresponding
Ocaml and Camlp4 files or directories are installed.

Then follow the same instructions above than for the Unix installation,
starting at point 2.
