OVERVIEW:

gwdiff will help you to target differences between two GeneWeb databases. So
far it can only compare the descendants of a person you have found in both
data bases (Spouses and their parents are compared too).

USAGE:

Your cousin has just sent you a new GEDCOM file, import it to GeneWeb (data
base b1). You want to update your data base (b2) according to b1 data base.
Now, find a person defined in both data bases (ex.: Jean DUPONT). In base b1,
it is "Jean.0 DUPONT"; in base b2, it is "Jean.3 DUPONT". Run the following
command:

 gwdiff -d1 Jean 0 DUPONT -d2 Jean 3 DUPONT b1 b2

So far, the checks include:
 - first name: value from b1 has to be found in b2 (first name or first name
    aliases)
 - surname: value from b1 has to be found in b2 (surname or surname aliases)
 - birth date
 - birth place: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the value)
 - death status
 - death date
 - death place: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the value)
 - occupation: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the value)
 - marriage date
 - marriage place: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the
    value)
 - divorce date
 - spouses
 - parents of spouses
 - children
