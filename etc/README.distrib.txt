To start with GeneWeb, you first need to execute some commands.

The simpler way is to launch the "setup" program. It allows you to
start by using your Web browser for these commands. All is explained
in the navigation.

   Under Windows, double-click on "setup".
   Under Unix, launch "setup" in an xterm.

If you are used to the interactive commands (MSdos, Xterm...) and
prefer know the basic commands of GeneWeb, go to the directory "gw"
and read the file README.txt.
