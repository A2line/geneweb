  - added option -nd setting flag "not dead" instead of "don't know if dead"
    for personal records where "DEAT" exists but is empty.

    the site in the navigator, the site was found but the navigator was
    waiting and waiting forever.
  - When updating a person, if the "notes" field holds only a newline,
    the request is rejected => fixed. Moreover some browsers add this "bad"
    newline if the notes fields is empty => fixed.

* gwd, a.cnf, lang/lexicon.txt

    in individual records

GeneWeb Version 1.0
-------------------

CGI mode is Ok.

---------------------------

Still intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode.

* gwd:
  - fixed bug: update did not work in cgi mode.
  - print person link after "family switch"
  - when using "add parents", surname is printed in child area => ability
    to change father's.

GeneWeb Version 1.0 beta.9
--------------------------

Intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode under Windows NT.

* More documentation

* gwd:
  - cgi is detected by the presence of environment variable QUERY_STRING.
    It seems that .bat files is not accepted in Web servers in Windows NT,
    so one must use "gwd" itself.
  - if "gwd" is installed in cgi directory, and is renamed, e.g. "geneweb.exe",
    ability to add a file named "geneweb.arg" holding some lines
       * the first line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where "lang" is installed
       * the second line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where the databases are installed
       * the third line, if existing, may hold the string "cgi" telling
            that gwd must run on "cgi" mode, even if QUERY_STRING is
            not set
  - added option -bd: bases directory
  - no error message now if background not found

* Deleted "add/person" in update (gwd) and in welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  => impossibility now to directly create isolated persons. This is because
  it often leads to manipulation errors. To add a new baby, use "modify
  family" from one of his parents' personal record.
