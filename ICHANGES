     because error while compiling base with names "Marie d'Orange" and

   - Fixed bug: while decoding strings fields, forgot to skip the possible
     space (underscored).

    "intermediate" version 1.05.

GeneWeb Version 1.05
--------------------

* gwc:
  - added "wrap=virtual" in notes updating.
  - added 1 generation in missing ancestors (because if a level complete =>
    nothing printed!)

  - generated images have now "content-length" (necessary for Netscape 2)

--------------------

* gwc:
  - added magic number in gwo files.
  - in case of option error, does not display usage, just invitation to
    use the -help option

* gwd:
  - fixed bug in relation: if same person, was not detected.
  - using new pa_html.cmo
  - added option "-nolock" not to create lock files; drawback: risk of
    scratching counter (not grave), or the database, if two users attempt
    to modify it at the same time; this option were only in Unix version,
    it is now added in Windows version too.
  - in research by names, "s" ending words are ignored
  - when refusing a log (fucking robots!), return status 403 and a small
    message; logs in "refuse_log".

  - fixed bug descend "only the generation concerned": persons descending
    several time were not factorized.

* gwd, consang:
  - in Windows NT/95, locking files never blocks: the action is just
    refused =>
    * when updating the base, if the base cannot be locked, the update is
      rejected.
    * when applying "consang", if the base cannot be locked, "consang" is
      rejected.
    * if the counter file cannot be locked, the counter is just not updated.

* gwc, gwu:
  - added "csrc" to factorize "#src" when all children have the same
