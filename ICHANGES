Internal, very small, or not visible changes
********************************************

GeneWeb Intermediate Version 2.01-1
-----------------------------------

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Apr 24, 99] Dont print "+" in short dates for died person if there is
    no death date and if the person is older than 120 years, as it was
    done in 2.01 for long dates displaying.

GeneWeb Version 2.01
--------------------

* General
  - [Mar 31..Apr 5, 99] Changed some types, labels, constructors, functions
    names, cleaned up some code.

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Apr 20, 99] Changed title text "nth generation" into "Generation n"
    because of necessity in Swedish to add another translation.
  - [Apr 19, 99] Added "value=on" in checkboxes generated HTML code. Seemed
    to be the default in several browsers (Netscape, IE, Lynx) but not all of
    them (Kfm).
  - [Apr 15, 99] Changed link of "gwd.opt", separating the objects in two
    parts, using cmxa files, because Windows 98 (or maybe Cygnus) does not
    work with this too long line, I don't know why. No difference in Unix.
  - [Apr 6, 99] Big cleanup about titles (hopefully not introducing bugs).
  - [Apr 3, 99] Dont print "died" in personal page if this is the only
    information (no date, no place) and if it is older than 120 years.
  - [Mar 22, 99] Ability to put "*" (to match any characters) in lines in
    exclude file.
  - [Mar 20, 99] When merging families, does not print any more the
    intermediate page when there is no differences to select.
  - [Mar 16, 99] Deleted display of trailing space in some links like in
    "Modify" in page "update" for example.
  - [Mar 14, 99] Cleaned up some generated HTML code.
  - [Mar 10, 99] Inlined "List.remove_assoc" in order to be compilable
    by Ocaml and Camlp4 2.01 as well.

* Welcome pages (hd/lang/xx/start.txt)
  - [Mar 20, 99] Changed order of links for displayed anniversaries and
    latest births and deaths.

* Lexicon (hd/lang/lexicon.txt)
  - [Mar 22, 99] Changed "allied%t (euphemism for married or... not) to"
    into "allied%d to". Changed French translation "allie" into "marie".

* Wserver (../wserver/wserver.ml)
  - [Mar 22, 99] Completed "special" list of characters that must be
    encoded (according to Jean-Christophe Filliatre).

GeneWeb Version 2.00
--------------------

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Mar 8, 99] Fixed bug for excluded addresses in cgi mode.
  - [Mar 4, 99] Deleted all "open Unix" and use of "Unix." for all unix
    function. Deleted "Pervasives.".
  - [Feb 27, 99] No more newline before the ending dot of the titles
    displaying in personal pages.
  - [Feb 18. 99] Added (undocumented) feature: adding ";opt=spouse" to an
    URL of relationship link (m=RL), the spouses are displayed.

* Doc
  - [Feb 23, 99] Correct HTML for creation of LICENSE.htm in directory doc.

GeneWeb Version 1.11
--------------------

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Jan 29, 99] Print clear messages when missing files (lexicon.txt, etc.)
  - [Jan 12, 99] Changed test in input_lexicon (gwd.ml): length of line < 4
    instead of line = "": better test to avoid failures when bad lexicon
    files.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Jan 16, 99] Ignore abnormal errors (displaying "uncaught exception:
    Stream.Failure").

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Jan 23, 99] Forgot to skip tabulations while reading lines in ".gw" files
  - [Jan 12, 99] Failure error now displayed in stdout instead of stderr.

* Most descendants computation (mostdesc)
  - [Jan 25, 99] Fixed little problem of alphabetic order.
  - [Jan 16, 99] Added mostdesc.opt in Makefile.

GeneWeb Version 1.10
--------------------

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [06/01/99] Added %y and %z as macros in srcfile.ml
  - [16/12/98] Translated some program record fields and constructors in
    english.
  - [16/12/98] Separated "base" into "base_data" and "base_func" to prepare
    code cleanup.
  - [15/12/98] Added forgotten i18n translation of "liens de parenté" (title)
    and added "head_no_page_title" in util's interface.
  - [14/12/98] Improved speed in families update: check_noloop made too
    many accesses to the base (unnecessary accesses to "persons").
  - [13/12/98] In src/num.ml, display at least "0" when number is 0!
  - [12/12/98] Fixed horrible programming of base patches applying, which
    resulted in much memory allocation and time loosing for bases having many
    added "things" (persons, families, strings). Now the code is cleaner.
    Consequence: saved speed and memory allocation in such bases in gwd,
    gwu, gwb2ged.
  - [11/12/98] Fixed bugs: newlines at end of fields displayed as newlines
    by "gwu", resulting of future syntax errors in "gwc"

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [11/12/98..12/12/98] Improved program (diminution of number of accesses
    to the base) to allow option "-mem"

* Most descendants (mostdesc.out)
  - [29/12/98] Sort persons with same number of time by alphabetic order.

* tools/camlp4_depend.sh
  - [13/12/98] Deleted "./" in depended file name, because that worked bad
    in alpha.

GeneWeb Version 1.09
--------------------

* gwc:
  - Added lazy building of topological sort file inside bases (accelerate
    Sosa number computing in personal pages and relationship links).
  - Send error and warning messages on stdout, instead of stderr.
  - Delete non printable characters (e.g. newlines) in strings (first names,
    etc.) coming from forms.
  - Fixed some displaying and behavior bugs when adding elements in merging
    forms.
  - Fixed some displayed "value=" when the value hold the " character
  - Some parts of relationship computing use big nums (module Num). Still
    incomplete.
  - Change in request syntax "relation... with..." to allow
    explicit first names and surnames instead of i=.
    Ex:
     old syntax (still there for compatibility during some versions)
       base?e=m%3DR%3Bi%3D31440&m=NG&n=somebody&t=PN
     new syntax:
       base?em=R;ei=31440&m=NG&n=somebody&t=PN
     and ability to write in a direct link:
       base?em=R;ep=jack;en=nicholson;eoc=3&m=NG&n=somebody&t=PN
     to be somewhat independant from the index of "jack nicholson" in
     the base.
  - Hidden options in requests:
       ";opt=from" in personal pages, gives the .gw origin file (if any)
       ";opt=misc" in personal pages, gives the list of miscellaneous names
  - More complete traces in CGI mode

* ged2gwb:
  - Display message "Strange input" giving the line number instead of character
    number.

* added tools/camlp4_depend.sh to compute dependencies with camlp4 .cmo files
  in src directory.

* added program "mostdesc" (not distributed in executable versions) computing
  the "most descendants from someone".

* changed "pauillac" into "cristal" in addresses.

GeneWeb Version 1.08
--------------------

* gwc:
  - Changed HTML generated by "last 10 births".
  - strip possible newlines in sources and comments while updating or
    creating families

GeneWeb Version 1.07
--------------------

* Documented structure of bases (file iobase.ml).
* ANSEL encoding in base

* gwc:
   - Fixed bug: hash table now with "crush_lower" names, not "strip_lower"
     because error while compiling base with names "Marie d'Orange" and
     "Marie Dorange", different in "gwd" but equal (beforewards) in "gwc".
   - Fixed bug: while decoding strings fields, forgot to skip the possible
     space (underscored).
   - A file "command.txt" is created into the base, showing the command
     line used like for the command "ged2gwb".

* gwd:
  - Don't display person number any more in update form when holding ? in
    his/her surname or first name
  - Fixed bug: when updating person, checks were done before patch.
  - Strip spaces of first names and surnames in forms.

* consang:
  - fixed bug: raised error for empty databases

* ged2gwb
  - not error if no space after initial number

GeneWeb Version 1.06
--------------------

* Restructuration (perestroika) for distribution of sources.

* gwd:
  - added cannot change sex of married person while updating person,
    this check was missing
  - changed Name.crush to separate case "roman numbers" and "i" is now
    treated as other vowels
  - changed "(%d fois)" into "(%d)" in "descendants, only the selected
    generation".
  - updateInd.ml: display number = index for first name or surname = "?"

* gwu:
  - fixed bug of behavior: created files even if not option -odir

* lexicon.txt:
  - integrated Lars' updates for swedish version... in fact integrated in
    "intermediate" version 1.05.

GeneWeb Version 1.05
--------------------

* gwc:
  - added "wrap=virtual" in notes updating.
  - added 1 generation in missing ancestors (because if a level complete =>
    nothing printed!)
  - fixed "Chantal.1 N..." did not work because of searching . from the right
  - generated images have now "content-length" (necessary for Netscape 2)
  - srcfile.ml: accept now [] in txt files => translation!
  - p.birth is now of type Adef.codate
  - suppressed nobr in descend.ml
  - suppressed <ul></ul> with no <li> in descend.ml
  - fixed bug: when creating or modifying someone, the test of existing was
    firstname1 ^ surname1 = firstname2 ^ surname2 instead of
    firstname1 = firstname2 && surname1 = surname2
  - Soza -> Sosa

GeneWeb Version 1.04
--------------------

* gwc:
  - added magic number in gwo files.
  - in case of option error, does not display usage, just invitation to
    use the -help option

* gwd:
  - fixed bug in relation: if same person, was not detected.
  - using new pa_html.cmo
  - added option "-nolock" not to create lock files; drawback: risk of
    scratching counter (not grave), or the database, if two users attempt
    to modify it at the same time; this option were only in Unix version,
    it is now added in Windows version too.
  - in research by names, "s" ending words are ignored
  - when refusing a log (fucking robots!), return status 403 and a small
    message; logs in "refuse_log".
  - added option -robot_xcl to test fast attacks.
  - fixed bug descend "only the generation concerned": persons descending
    several time were not factorized.

* gwd, consang:
  - in Windows NT/95, locking files never blocks: the action is just
    refused =>
    * when updating the base, if the base cannot be locked, the update is
      rejected.
    * when applying "consang", if the base cannot be locked, "consang" is
      rejected.
    * if the counter file cannot be locked, the counter is just not updated.

* gwc, gwu:
  - added "csrc" to factorize "#src" when all children have the same
