<h1>Creation of a database</h1>

$v{Warning: there already exists a database with the name "$o" in your
<a href="setup?lang=$l;v=list.html">directory</a>. If you push the button
"Ok" below, it will be erased.<p>

If you just made this handling, it is probably its result, and therefore
it is not important. Else, return to the previous page and choose another
name for your database.<p>}

We are going to create a database named "$o". Remark: this operation
can answer in the twinkling of a eye or take some tenths of seconds or
some minutes, depending on the cases. Be patient.

<p>

Push the button below to create you database$v{, and scratch the previous
database "$o" of the target directory}:

<p>

<form mode=GET action="$d">
$h
<dl><dd><input type=submit value="Ok"></dl>
</form>

<p>

For information, this operation corresponds to the following commands:

<pre>
     $$ cd $w
     $$ $c$p &gt; comm.log
</pre>

This builds a directory named "$o.gwb".
