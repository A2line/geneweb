<h1>Note</h1>

Some Web browsers, which propose a browse button, do not allow to select
<em>directories</em> but only <em>files</em>: indeed, by clicking on
a directory, they give you the list of the files inside, but it does
not allow you to "exit" with the directory itself.

<p>

If it is the case of your Web browser, to select your directory,
select any file inside it. The program "gwsetup" understands that it
is the directory you are talking about.

<p>

Another solution, if the directory is empty or holds only directories,
is to select a file close to the directory, to accept the browsing and
then afterwards in the input area fix the good access path to the
directory.
