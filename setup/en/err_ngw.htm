<h1>Error</h1>

You selected the directory:

<p>

<pre>
     $a
</pre>

But it does not hold the command "gwu" required to transfer your
data base. Are you sure it is a <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> distribution directory?

<p>

Or else, it may be a very old version of <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> where the
command "gwu" was called "gwb2gw". If it is the case, rename the file
"gwb2gw" into "gwu" in this directory and try again.

<p>

Return to the previous screen.
