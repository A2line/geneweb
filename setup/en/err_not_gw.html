<h1>Erreur</h1>

You selected the directory:

<p>

<pre>
     $a
</pre>

But it does not hold the command "gwu" required to transfer your
database. Are you sure it is a <em>GeneWeb</em> distribution diretory?

<p>

Or else, it may be a very old version of <em>GeneWeb</em> where the
command "gwu" was called "gwb2gw". If it is the case, rename the file
"gwb2gw" into "gwu" in this directory and try again.

<p>

Return to the previous screen.
