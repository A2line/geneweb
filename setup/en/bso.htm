<h1>Creation of a data base</h1>

$v{Warning: there already exists a data base with the name "$o" in your
<a href="gwsetup?lang=$l;v=list.htm">directory</a>. If you push the button
"Ok" below, it will be erased.<p>

If you just made this, it is probably its result, and therefore it is
not important. Else, return to the previous page and choose another
name for your data base.<p>}

We are going to create a data base named "$o". Remark: this operation
can answer in the twinkling of a eye or take some tenths of seconds or
some minutes, depending on the cases. Be patient.

<p>

Push the button below to create you data base$v{, and overwrite the previous
data base "$o" of the target directory}:

<p>

<form method=GET action="$d">
$h
<dl><dt><dd><input type=submit value="Ok"></dl>
</form>

<p>

For information, this operation corresponds to the following commands:

<pre>
     $$ cd $w
     $$ $c$p &gt; comm.log
</pre>

This builds a directory named "$o.gwb".
