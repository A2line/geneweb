Go to your Web browser and open the address:
       http://localhost:$z/

Warning: for this program to work, you must not delete this window!

If it does not work, you may have to configurate, in your browser,
options like "work off-line" or "do not use the proxy for local
addresses" or "do not connect to Internet for the address
'localhost'".

If despite your efforts, it still does not answer, try the classical
procedure by looking at the documentation. For that, stop this program
by typing "control-c" in this window, go to the directory "gw" and
open the file:
   INSTALL.htm
