Go to your Web browser and open one of the following addresses:
       http://127.0.0.1:$z/
       http://localhost:$z/

Warning: for this program to work, you must not delete this window!

If none of theses addresses work, you may have to configure, in your
browser, options like "work off-line" or "do not use the proxy for
local addresses" or "do not connect to Internet for the address
'localhost'".

If despite your efforts, it still does not answer, try the classical
procedure by looking at the documentation. For that, stop this program
by typing "control-c" in this window, go to the directory "gw" and
open the file:
   INSTALL.htm

But you risk to meet the same problem a little bit further...
