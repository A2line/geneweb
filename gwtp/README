What is gwtp?

Gwtp is a CGI program allowing people to upload and download their
GeneWeb data bases on a Web site and change their configuration
parameters.


Installation on an Unix Web server

In the site machine, create a directory which is *not* accessible on
the Web, with any name you want. In that directory, copy the executable
'gwtp' and the files 'send.txt', 'recv.txt', 'conf.txt', and create an
empty file named 'passwd'. Put all read/write access rights (chmod a+rw)
to that directory.

Go to the cgi-bin directory and create you CGI (e.g. gwtp.cgi),
holding the following lines, replacing the texts between brackets
by the correct values:

  #!/bin/sh
  tmp=[the above directory holding gwtp and the .txt files]
  dst=[the directory holding the GeneWeb data bases]
  site=[the URL of the GeneWeb site]
  cd $tmp
  ./gwtp -tmp $tmp -dst $dst -site $site

The above variable 'site' is the Web address of a GeneWeb data base
*minus* its name. Things like that:
   http://my.site.net/cgi-bin/geneweb.cgi?b=
   http://my.site.net:2317/

Make your CGI executable:
   chmod a+x gwtp.cgi

Then, when accessing that CGI, people get a login page where they have to
enter a data base name and a password.


Adding an user

To add a new accomodated data base, just add a line in the passwd file
of the directory $tmp above, holding:
    base:passwd

replacing "base" by the name of the data base you want and "passwd" by
a complicated enough password. Send these values to the data base owner.

The data base owner can then access the CGI and log in. The first
time, he has to configurate his data base parameters; once done, he
can upload his data base. Later, using the same login, he can at any
time change his configuration, or upload or download his GeneWeb
data base.


Removing an user

Remove his entry in the passwd file, delete his GeneWeb data base
(directory ending with ".gwb"), and delete his data base configuration
file (file ending with ".gwf").
