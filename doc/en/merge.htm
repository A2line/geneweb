<h1>GeneWeb - Merging databases</h1>

This part indicates the procedure to you to merge databases. It is
still rather manual, but it may be improved in the future.

<p>

The merging of data bases is done in two steps:

<p><ul><li> First gathering the two bases into a new one.</ul>

<p><ul><li> Second, merging the persons.</ul>

<h4> First step: concatenation of bases </h4>

That can be done only in an interactive window (see "How to start with
GeneWeb").

<p><ul><li> If you have a base called "foo" and another which is
called "bar", extract these two bases as source files with the command
"gwu". Type:

<pre>
     gwu foo &gt; foo.gw
     gwu bar &gt; bar.gw
</pre>

</ul>

<p><ul><li> Create a common base "base".  Type:

<pre>
     gwc foo.gw bar.gw -o base
</pre>

It may happens (and probably it will) that gwc displays errors because
persons are defined twice in "foo.gw" and "bar.gw". To fix that, gwc
has an option "-sh" to shift the numbers of the persons and to avoid
conflicts. Try:

<pre>
     gwc foo.gw -sh 10 bar.gw -o base
</pre>

If the value 10 does not solve the problem, try 20, 30 or 100...

</ul>

<h4> Second step: merge of persons </h4>

You now have a data base "base" holding "toto" and "titi" with some
persons recorded twice.

<p>

You will be able to merge these people in your navigator. If "gwd" is
not launched, launch it.

<p>

Then apply <a href="update.htm#Merg">persons merging</a>, which is in
the part "How to make modifications in the data base" (forget the
comment about the fact that it is not about "databases merging").

<h4> Final cleaning up </h4>

At the end of merging, it is wise to make a final cleaning up of the
base. Indeed, when persons or families are removed (what occurs when
merging are done), the space of the removed persons and families is
not recovered. In particular, the welcome page always indicates the
same number of persons.

<p>

To do the cleaning up of the base "base" (you can make at any time,
and even several times), use again an interactive window. Type:

<pre>
     gwu base &gt; base.gw
     gwc base.gw -o base
</pre>

<p>

Note that if you want to scratch the old base "foo", type simply "-o
foo" in this second command:

<pre>
     gwc base.gw -o foo
</pre>
