<h4>My genealogic software tells me that the base holds 3000
individuals, but GeneWeb says: 3050 individuals. Why this
difference?</h4>

In <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, parents are always recorded in couple. When there
is just the father or just the mother in the GEDCOM file,
<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> adds the other parent, giving her or him a question
mark as first name and surname. The difference are these missing (but
having existed) parents.

<h4>At the first use of GeneWeb, I get the message: Cannot access file
"start.txt".</h4>

Look at the doc: "Two frequently encountered <a
href=problem.htm>problems</a>". If it does not work better, please
tell me.

<h4>When displaying relationship links, some are missing.</h4>

<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> does not display the links such that the right
(resp. left) person is descended from a person of the left
(resp. right) branch.

<p>

Because those relationship links become often so numerous that the
displaying is unreadable. They are real relationship links, however,
and are counted in the consanguinity computing.
