<h4>At the first use of GeneWeb, I get the message: Cannot access file
"start.txt".</h4>

Look at the doc: "Two frequently encountered <a
href=problem.htm>problems</a>". If it does not work better, please
tell me.

<h4>It does not work at all under Windows!</h4>

A frequent problem is that your Web browser, seeing that you entered a
Web address (http://...), tries to connect to the network and if you
disconnected you modem, it refuses. It is an error of Window, because
the address being "localhost", it should not try to connect:
"localhost" means "your own computer".

<p>

It it due to the fact that your internet provider installed on your
computer a program of automatic connection. This automatic connection
is responsible to this phenomenon. A solution is therefore to
disconnect it. Search in a menu which must be named "preferences" or
"options" or "configuration" a tab in which you see the automatic
connection and disconnect it.

<p>

Another solution is to use another Web browser: if you internet
provider installed Internet Explorer in your computer, use
Netscape. If it installed Netscape, use Internet Explorer.

<p>

A third solution is to connect your modem, and wait for the
connection. When it is done, does it work? If yes, then we are sure
that it was the problem. Disconnecting then your modem, it often goes
on working. Of course, it is not very satisfactory since you have to
connect each time you want to use <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, even if it is for only 10
seconds.

<p>

Information from an user (Paul Laredo, thanks to him):

<p>

<ol>

<li>launch gwsetup (or gwd)

<li>launch you Web browser

<li>stop the automatic connection with the provider

<li>type the address of the service

<li>it displays that the page is not available off line, you must
not click on the button "work off line" which is displayed but on
"connect".

</ol>

<p>

<h4>My genealogic software tells me that the base holds 3000
individuals, but GeneWeb says: 3050 individuals. Why this
difference?</h4>

In <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, parents are always recorded in couple. When there
is just the father or just the mother in the GEDCOM file,
<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> adds the other parent, giving her or him a question
mark as first name and surname. The difference are these missing (but
having existed) parents.

<h4>When displaying relationship links, some are missing.</h4>

To avoid that the listing of relationship links be too long, <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> deletes some of them when
displaying the result. For this, it uses the following method: when a
relationship link is found with a common ancestor, all the ancestors
of this ancestor are eliminated from the research.

<p>

A consequence of this pruning is that if one asks for the computation
of a relationship link with an ancestor, he will be displayed only as
an ancestor, even if he can sometimes also be a cousin.

<p>

For example, if my father and my mother are cousins, and if I am looking
for my relationships with my mother, it only indicates that I am her son,
not that I am her cousin's son, even if this link really exists.

<p>

Pruning is necessary: without it, for families a little bit "intermixed",
the displaying rapidly becomes invaded by a lot a relationship links and
eventually ununderstandable (I tested it).

<p>

The non displayed relationship links are however real relationship
links, and are counted in the consanguinity computing.

<p>

<h4>In CGI mode I just get a message "Internal Server Error"</h4>

A frequent problem is about access rights. The Web server often runs
CGIs as an user with very few rights (typically user "nobody" under
Unix). It may not be able to run "gwd". Check the access rights of
"gwd" and all the <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> files!

<h4>Why the age of persons of more than 80 years old is not displayed? Why
aren't they in the statistics of the oldest persons?</h4>

In <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, the indication of death
has three states: "alive", "died" and "don't know". The age is
displayed only for "alive" (still living) persons. If the age is not
there, the reason is that either the person is dead (without
indication of date), or the indication is at "don't know".

<p>

If you added this person with <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> and that you did not specify if
he/she is alive or dead, or if your data base comes from a GEDCOM file
(the indication "still living person" being not planed in standard
GEDCOM 5.5), <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> applies the
following algorithm:

<ul>

<li>if the person is less than 80 years old, he/she is indicated "alive".

<li>if he/she is more than 120 years old, he/she is indicated "dead".

<li>between the two ages, he/she is indicated "don't know".

</ul>

You have to fix these indications if they are incorrect.

<p>

<h4>The persons having ? (question mark) as first name and/or surname
seem to have a specific status. Which one and why?</h4>

These persons are considered by <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> as "dead-ends": if they are
children, they cannot be spouses, if they are spouses, they cannot
have parents.  And they cannot have associated notes.

<p>

Moreover, if they are spouses, they are not exported in the GEDCOM
files and their personnal information (if any), is consequently lost.

<p>

It is sometimes possible, by hacking, to manage to give them notes of
to link them, but warning: at the first cleaning up of the data base,
these notes and links are going to disappear: it is therefore advised
against not doing that.

<p>

The first name/surname "?" being therefore "reserved" in GeneWeb, you
must not name people like that if you want that these persons be
linkable to the rest of the data base or if you want to attach them
notes or relations (godparents, adoptive parents or children, and so
on.). The solution is to edit these persons and change their surname
or their first name to something else: put "N", "Ne", "N...", "x",
"??", what you want but not just "?".

<p>

<h4>Could you improve the "advanced request" by "this" or "that"?</h4>

The "advanced request" is a hack I programmed but which is not very
satisfactory. As <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> does not
use a real data base system, any improvement of this part would
consist on rewriting a new data base system, which I don't plan to do,
because it is a huge work.

<p>

If, one day, <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> uses a true
data base system (it is among the possible directions), this
advanced request will be probably rewritten, and will be much more
powerful and easy to use.

<p>

<h4>Would it be possible to have a complete displaying of ancestors, even
with repetitions of Sosa numbers?</h4>

I understand that it would be useful, but there are big problems. I
already experimented this feature but I became aware, for persons
having many ancestors, of the fact that the displaying was full of
references to other ancestors and became unreadable. Moreover this
triggers much computation ("exponential algorithm").

<p>

If you want to know if an ancestor line is full, look at the reverse
problem using "missing ancestors".

<p>

<h4>What is the convention of short dates displaying?</h4>

<pre>
     Smith 1935-1950 = born in 1935, died in 1950
     Smith 1935-     = born in 1935, not dead (still alive)
     Smith 1935 +    = born in 1935, died unknown date
     Smith *1935     = born in 1935, don't know if dead or not
     Smith +1950     = died in 1950, unknown birth date

        /1935        = before 1935
        1935/        = after 1935
        ca 1935      = about 1935
                       perhaps in 1935
        1935/1938    = in 1935 or in 1938
                       between 1935 and 1938
</pre>

This convention does not refer to a specific "standard". If you know
a better, more known, more standard convention, don't hesitate to tell
me. Thanks.

<h4>Would it be possible that you add more information about persons in
the "families" update forms, in order to go faster?</h4>

It would certainly be nice, but I don't like adding things. The most I
add, the most people ask me. In the beginning, I put only the person's
name, then I was asked to add dates, I added dates, then places, I
added places, then people ask me to add the dates precisions, the
occupations, and so on. All these informations increase the size of
this "family" form which is already rather complicated.

<p>

I know that it it tedious to have to return to the "person" form for
each added person, but I am not sure that adding and adding things be
the good solution. It is also an intrinsic problem of HTML, which is
not very "dynamic". However, I am personnaly against solutions using
Java (risks of security holes) and JavaScript (language actually
destinated to be invaded by advertising, among other drawbacks). Other
solutions are being studied, but not easy to implement.

<h4>In an update form, I filled some fields, but they disapear</h4>

Some fields are taken into account only in certain circumstances. So,
is a person is noticed "alive", the fields "date" and "place" of death
are ignored. If, in a "family" form, the field "separated" is selected,
the field "divorce date" is ignored. If the indication of a person if
"Link" (instead of "Create"), the fields about sex, date and place
are ignored. And so on.

<p>

Generally, in such kind of forms, the choices are invalidated or validated
back when one select such or such button. It is not possible to program
that due to the fact that <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> is
limitated to pure HTML: JavaScript should be used, which is against my
principles (see the question about the the families update forms).

<p>

<h4>When I make a research by place/surname, if the result give several
persons for a surname, only the first one is accessible</h4>

Indeed. In a first version, I made a link to the surname itself, and
not to a person, but when the surname holds many persons, you don't
know at all who is concerned by this "place" and it is difficult to
find them.

<p>

Give the first person is more "informative". Yes, it is incomplete, and
the ideal would be to have the list of all the persons concerned by this
place, but it supposed that I programmed several things more, and it
has the drawback that the request uses much more memory space.

<p>

You can access the list of all the persons of this surname by cliquing
on the surname in the person's displayed page.
