<h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>

<h4>My genealogic software tells me that the base holds 3000
individuals, but GeneWeb says: 3050 individuals. Why this
difference?</h4>

In <em>GeneWeb</em>, parents are always recorded in couple. When there
is just the father or just the mother in the GEDCOM file,
<em>GeneWeb</em> adds the other parent, giving her or him a question
mark as first name and surname. The difference are these missing (but
having existed) parents.

<h4>Why some dates are transformed by ged2gwb into "maybe in..."?</h4>

When <em>GeneWeb</em> cannot recognize a date in a GEDCOM file,
probably because this date does not follows the standard
GEDCOM&nbsp;5.5 (but it may be a bug in GeneWeb: in this case, please
tell me), it tries to find something looking like a year in the date
text. And it adds it a "maybe" to indicate that it is not sure of
this.

<h4>At the first use of GeneWeb, I get the message: Cannot access file
"start.txt".</h4>

Look at the doc: "Two frequently encountered <a
href=problem.htm>problems</a>". If it does not work better, please
tell me.

<h4>When displaying relationship links, some are missing.</h4>

<em>GeneWeb</em> does not display the links such that the right
(resp. left) person is descended from a person of the left
(resp. right) branch.

<p>

Because those relationship links become often so numerous that the
displaying is unreadable. They are real relationship links, however,
and are counted in the consanguinity computing.
