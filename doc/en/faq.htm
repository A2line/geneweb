<h4>My genealogic software tells me that the base holds 3000
individuals, but GeneWeb says: 3050 individuals. Why this
difference?</h4>

In <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, parents are always recorded in couple. When there
is just the father or just the mother in the GEDCOM file,
<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> adds the other parent, giving her or him a question
mark as first name and surname. The difference are these missing (but
having existed) parents.

<h4>At the first use of GeneWeb, I get the message: Cannot access file
"start.txt".</h4>

Look at the doc: "Two frequently encountered <a
href=problem.htm>problems</a>". If it does not work better, please
tell me.

<h4>When displaying relationship links, some are missing.</h4>

<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> does not display the links
such that the right (resp. left) person is descended from a person of
the left (resp. right) branch.

<p>

Because those relationship links become often so numerous that the
displaying is unreadable. They are real relationship links, however,
and are counted in the consanguinity computing.

<p>

<h4>In CGI mode I just get a message "Internal Server Error"</h4>

A frequent problem is about access rights. The Web server often runs
CGIs as an user with very few rights (typically user "nobody" under
Unix). It may not be able to run "gwd". Check the access rights of
"gwd" and all the <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> files!

<h4>Why the age of persons of more than 80 years old is not displayed? Why
aren't they in the statistics of the oldest persons?</h4>

In <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, the indication of death
has three states: "alive", "died" and "don't know". The age is
displayed only for "alive" (still living) persons. If the age is not
there, the reason is that either the person is dead (without
indication of date), or the indication is at "don't know".

<p>

If you added this person with <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> and that you did not specify if
he/she is alive or dead, or if your data base comes from a GEDCOM file
(the indication "still living person" being not planed in standard
GEDCOM 5.5), <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> applies the
following algorithm:

<ul>

<li>if the person is less than 80 years old, he/she is indicated "alive".

<li>if he/she is more than 120 years old, he/she is indicated "dead".

<li>between the two ages, he/she is indicated "don't know".

</ul>

You have to fix these indications if they are incorrect.
