<h4>My genealogic software tells me that the base holds 3000
individuals, but GeneWeb says: 3050 individuals. Why this
difference?</h4>

In <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, parents are always recorded in couple. When there
is just the father or just the mother in the GEDCOM file,
<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> adds the other parent, giving her or him a question
mark as first name and surname. The difference are these missing (but
having existed) parents.

<h4>At the first use of GeneWeb, I get the message: Cannot access file
"start.txt".</h4>

Look at the doc: "Two frequently encountered <a
href=problem.htm>problems</a>". If it does not work better, please
tell me.

<h4>When displaying relationship links, some are missing.</h4>

<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> does not display the links
such that the right (resp. left) person is descended from a person of
the left (resp. right) branch.

<p>

Because those relationship links become often so numerous that the
displaying is unreadable. They are real relationship links, however,
and are counted in the consanguinity computing.

<p>

<h4>In CGI mode I just get a message "Internal Server Error"</h4>

A frequent problem is about access rights. The Web server often runs
CGIs as an user with very few rights (typically user "nobody" under
Unix). It may not be able to run "gwd". Check the access rights of
"gwd" and all the <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> files!

<h4>Why the age of persons of more than 80 years old is not displayed? Why
aren't they in the statistics of the oldest persons?</h4>

In <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>, the indication of death
has three states: "alive", "died" and "don't know". The age is
displayed only for "alive" (still living) persons. If the age is not
there, the reason is that either the person is dead (without
indication of date), or the indication is at "don't know".

<p>

If you added this person with <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> and that you did not specify if
he/she is alive or dead, or if your data base comes from a GEDCOM file
(the indication "still living person" being not planed in standard
GEDCOM 5.5), <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> applies the
following algorithm:

<ul>

<li>if the person is less than 80 years old, he/she is indicated "alive".

<li>if he/she is more than 120 years old, he/she is indicated "dead".

<li>between the two ages, he/she is indicated "don't know".

</ul>

You have to fix these indications if they are incorrect.

<p>

<h4>The persons having ? (question mark) as first name and/or surname
seem to have a specific status. Which one and why?</h4>

These persons are considered by <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> as "dead-ends": if they are
children, they cannot be spouses, if they are spouses, they cannot
have parents.  And they cannot have associated notes.

<p>

Moreover, if they are spouses, they are not exported in the GEDCOM
files and their personnal information (if any), is consequently lost.

<p>

It is sometimes possible, by hacking, to manage to give them notes of
to link them, but warning: at the first cleaning up of the data base,
these notes and links are going to disappear: it is therefore advised
against not doing that.

<p>

The first name/surname "?" being therefore "reserved" in GeneWeb, you
must not name people like that if you want that these persons be
linkable to the rest of the data base or if you want to attach them
notes or relations (godparents, adoptive parents or children, and so
on.). The solution is to edit these persons and change their surname
or their first name to something else: put "N", "Ne", "N...", "x",
"??", what you want but not just "?".

<p>

<h4>Could you improve the "advanced request" by "this" or "that"?</h4>

The "advanced request" is a hack I programmed but which is not very
satisfactory. As <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> does not
use a real data base system, any improvement of this part would
consist on rewriting a new data base system, which I don't plan to do,
because it is a huge work.

<p>

If, one day, <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> uses a true
data base system (it is among the possible directions), this
advanced request will be probably rewritten, and will be much more
powerful and easy to use.

<p>

<h4>Would it be possible to have a complete displaying of ancestors, even
with repetitions of Sosa numbers?</h4>

I understand that it would be useful, but there are big problems. I
already experimented this feature but I became aware, for persons
having many ancestors, of the fact that the displaying was full of
references to other ancestors and became unreadable. Moreover this
triggers much computation ("exponential algorithm").

<p>

If you want to know if an ancestor line is full, look at the reverse
problem using "missing ancestors".

<p>

<h4>What is the convention of short dates displaying?</h4>

<pre>
     Smith 1935-1950 = born in 1935, died in 1950
     Smith 1935-     = born in 1935, not dead (still alive)
     Smith 1935 +    = born in 1935, died unknown date
     Smith *1935     = born in 1935, don't know if dead or not
     Smith +1950     = died in 1950, unknown birth date

        /1935        = before 1935
        1935/        = after 1935
        ca 1935      = about 1935
                       perhaps in 1935
        ca 1535/1538 = in 1935 or in 1938
                       between 1935 and 1938
</pre>

This convention does not refer to a specific "standard". If you know
a better, more known, more standard convention, don't hesitate to tell
me. Thanks.
