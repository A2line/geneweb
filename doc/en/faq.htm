<h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>

I am just starting this FAQ. For the moment, I just answer two of
them. I add more questions later.

<h4>My genealogic software tells me that the base holds 3000
individuals, but GeneWeb says: 3050 individuals. Why this
difference?</h4>

In <em>GeneWeb</em>, parents are always recorded in couple. When there
is just the father or just the mother in the GEDCOM file,
<em>GeneWeb</em> adds the other parent, giving her or him a question
mark as first name and surname. The difference are these missing (but
having existed) parents.

<h4>Why some dates are transformed through ged2gwb into "maybe
in..."?</h4>

When <em>GeneWeb</em> cannot recognize a date in a GEDCOM file,
probably because this date does not follows the standard
GEDCOM&nbsp;5.5 (but it may be a bug in GeneWeb: in this case, please
tell me), it tries to find something looking like a year in the date
text. And it adds it a "maybe" to indicate that it is not sure of
this.
