NOT FIXED

[11 Feb 2005] Bug in version 5.00-exp
  Surnames and first names by alphabetic order do not work for deleted or
  renamed persons (the index is not updated). This bug probably still existed
  in previous versions. Urgency 4/5.

[08 Feb 2005] Since version 5.00-exp
  Some variables in perso.txt do not work in all cases. Due to rewritting of
  code to make it cleaner. Cases to be checked. Urgency 3/5.

[08 Feb 2005] Probable bug in version 5.00-exp
  Running "consang" on old databases (i.e. created before utf-8) may create
  bad utf-8 strings (names, texts, etc.), because there is no conversion.
  Np idea for the moment how to fix it. Anyway, this error has not been
  experimented, it is just supposed. Urgency 1/5.

FIXED

[12 Feb 2005] Bug appeared in version 4.10
  gwc do not set the sex of isolated "relation" (godparents, etc.) Due
  to memory optimization in code version 4.10 (which were important
  in large databases).
