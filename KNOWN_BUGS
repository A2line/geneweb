[08 Feb 2005] Bug in version 5.00-exp
  Surnames and first names by alphabetic order do not work. Code has been
  to be rewritten because of utf-8. Urgency 5/5.

[08 Feb 2005] Bug since version 4.10
  gwc and ged2gwb do not set the sex of isolated "relation" (godparents,
  etc.) (and probable warnings for fixes like reordering children are not
  done). Due to memory optimization in code version 4.10 (which is important
  for large databases). Urgency 3/5.

[08 Feb 2005] Since version 5.00-exp
  Variables in perso.txt do not work in all cases. Due to rewritting of
  code to make it cleaner. Urgency 3/5.

[08 Feb 2005] Probable bug in version 5.00-exp
  Running "consang" on old databases (i.e. created before utf-8) may create
  bad utf-8 strings (names, texts, etc.), because there is no conversion.
  Np idea for the moment how to fix it. Anyway, this error has not been
  experimented, it is just supposed.
